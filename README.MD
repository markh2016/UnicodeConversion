Os Platform used  OpenSuse 15.1  written with for assistance with  Arduino library 
For query raised at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1400884323467285

Tool  is written in Java  to convert UTF-8 to Unicode and then Hex codes  with file creation for both Unicode and hex derivatives 
The tool will come in very useful for quickly converting codes to  both hex and raw Unicode 
You will also need native2ascii Java tool installed which  comes as standard with Java 8 if not you will need to check this before attempting to run this 

To do this open a console  , Terminal and type at the command prompt >>  whereis native2ascii
This should return paths if installed 


This is used within the Java code  as a far easier method with tools  that would be present on your system   trusting that you have Java installed 
The intention of this was to throw some light on how to  use the MD_parola library for arduino for Kristoffer Revi  From Norway 
which is the quickest solution i could come up with 
This should however be of use to anyone wishing to utilise  Unicode for other devlopment 

If you would like to add improvements or suggest anything please by all means do so 

Thanking you and here is the entire solution uploaded  for you
